								<p>Hi!, welcome to my portfolio-website. My name is Meiko and I
									am currently in the 6th semester of my computer science
									studies in Lübeck, Germany.</p>
								<p>On this website I want to give you a closer read of what I am
									 doing and what I am interested in. To have a look at my current & past projects,
								 	 please visit my GitHub!</p>
								<p>While being a full time student I tutored three different
									courses, I am programming on a daily and workout once every two days.

							<h2>Tutoring at the University of Lübeck</h2>
							<p>Includes correction of exercise sheets & exercise supervision</p>

									<h4>Tutoring "Software Engineering"</h4>
									<p>Diagramming, Software-Development Process, Quality & Management</p>
								</header>
								My first tutoring job at the university of Lübeck was for the lecture "Software Engnieering" at the institute for Software Engineering and Programming
								Languages (ISP). I decided to apply for this specific course as I didn't dive as deep as I would've like to during the semester,
								thus giving me the opportunity to go through it again in even more detail. Now, being the student assistent, I am tutoring during
								the winter semester and supervise the hands-on software development in summer semesters, as this lecture is split into the theoretical
								and the practical part. The theoretical part (winter semesters) of the lecture goes into detail concerning software quality,
								modeling in softwaredevelopement, the phases a software project goes through, some design patterns and management in terms
								of softwaredevelopment. During the summer semesters students had to overengineer boardgames, including most diagramms introduced
								in the winter semester, writing tests and designing a GUI. As a tutor you get about 10 groups you supervise and help if necessary.
								All in all it has been a fun experience and a good practice to work with and supervise small groups of future software engineers.

									<h4>Tutoring "Algorithms & Datastructures"</h4>
									<p>Fundamentals, Complexity & Estimation</p>
								</header>
								The second tutoring job I landed was at the Institute of Information Systems (IFIS). I especially wanted to return back to my second
								semester's favorite to get an indepth recap of the things that really pathed my studies; The fundamental algorithms and basic
								datastructures, what makes them special and how exactly do they work. The topics this lecture covered surrounded various sorting
								algorithms, hashing, many treestructures and their algorithms such as dijkstra, dynamic programming and introduced the idea of complexity
								classes, for example P and NP. In contrast to my first tutoring in software engineering, this was a whole different setup to work in,
								because the focus	was a more theoretical one. Explaining and discussing the complexity and benefits of certain algorithms compared to others really
								helped me improve my overall understanding of efficiency and computability

								<header>
									<h4>Tutoring "Developement of Safety-Critical Software"</h4>
									<p>Theorem Proving, Model Checking, Runtime Verification & Rust</p>
								</header>
								My third and final tutoring job at the university of Lübeck was for the lecture "Development of Safety-Critical Software" at the
								institute for Software Engineering and Programming Languages (ISP) (again). I was given the opportunity to tutor as I graduated the
								course with the years highest grade and while achiving a good final grade, I was really unsatisfied with the way the given Information
								was presented. With a change in exercise management, I was consulted to review and revision the lectures slides and overall structure.
								Due to the very intense confrontation with the lectures topics I grew even more confident in safety critical software developement
								processes and got a good understanding of the methods and how they can be integrated in a common, day to day software engineering process.
